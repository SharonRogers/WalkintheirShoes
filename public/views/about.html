		<p class="info1">When was the last time you felt a guttural reaction to something you heard or saw? The pang that makes you hurt or rejoice for another person. The pang that fills your chest with the warmth of joy that is not your own…that vicarious experience is empathy. It is truly the imperative piece of human nature that will ensure happiness, peace and more love in our world, our community and in ourselves.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="info2">Empathy, which is the identification with or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another, though similar to sympathy, goes one step further. Sympathy simply creates a relationship between persons or things whereas the act of empathy moves one to deeply experience another’s emotions. Empathy causes us to act or prevent actions and it helps us to understand how others may be struggling which can then lead to solutions or a commitment to help. This is how we can change the world.</p>
